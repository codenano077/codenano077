# Hi, I'm codenano077 👋
Game developer, graphics tinkerer, and algorithm student — I build playable prototypes, graphics tools, and practice data structures & algorithms across C#, GDScript, JavaScript, C++, Java, and R.

---

## ⭐ Quick highlights
- 🔭 Building games & graphics tools: platformers, fighting games, and OpenGL systems  
- 🧩 Languages: C#, GDScript (Godot), JavaScript, C++, Java, R, HTML/CSS  
- 🔁 Practice: Data Structures & Algorithms (Java_DSA — private repo)  
- ⚡ Interests: game design, real-time graphics, gameplay systems, and algorithmic problem solving

---

## 🛠 Tech & tools
- Engines & APIs: Godot (GDScript), Unity-style workflows (C#), OpenGL (C++)
- Languages: C#, GDScript, JavaScript, C++, Java, R, HTML/CSS
- Workflow: Git, asset pipelines, iteration-focused prototyping

## 🔭 Featured projects
- platform_game01 — Platformer prototype / toolkit (C#)  
  https://github.com/codenano077/platform_game01  
  A large C# codebase for platformer mechanics and level prototypes (big asset/project size — active iteration).

- zombiegame — Godot zombie survival prototype (GDScript)  
  https://github.com/codenano077/zombiegame  
  Prototype built with Godot using GDScript: AI, spawning, and basic enemy/player interactions.

- Fighting-game — Browser-based fighting demo (JavaScript)  
  https://github.com/codenano077/Fighting-game  
  Lightweight fighting mechanics and demo scenes implemented in JavaScript for rapid playtesting.

- OPEN_GL-cameraSystem — Graphics / camera system (C++)  
  https://github.com/codenano077/OPEN_GL-cameraSystem  
  Major C++ project focusing on camera control and OpenGL rendering utilities.

- Java_DSA (private) — Java data structures & algorithms practice  
  https://github.com/codenano077/Java_DSA (private)  
  Collection of algorithm solutions and practice problems in Java — used for interview prep and skill sharpening.

## 🧭 How I work
- Fast prototyping: get playable builds in front of users quickly  
- Iterate on feel: prioritize gameplay feel, then polish systems  
- Component-driven: modular behaviors and reusable systems for rapid experimentation  
- Learn by building: each project targets a specific mechanic or engine feature
